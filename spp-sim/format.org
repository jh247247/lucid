* File and packet format
  The only difference between packets sent over bluetooth and a file
  is that the file has everything concatenated together. So, we can
  use the same code for both.

  Note that everything is encoded in binary, so things might go a bit
  funny at some point.
** Header
   The header is relatively simple, with the starting byte defining
   the type of the packet.
   | Byte | Packet type                                       |
   | 0x00 | Element/Depth                                     |
   | 0x01 | Timestamp (May need to be added by phone to file) |
** Element
   - Header is one byte (0x00)
   - The next 16 bits define the start of the element depth
   - The next 16 bits define the end of the element depth
   - The next byte defines the chars per sample, since this will be
     encoded as base64 to avoid byte stuffing.
   - So, finally comes the data. Hopefully this is
     (end-start)*charsPerSample
   - If it isn't, what do we do?
     - Attempt to resync on the next non-base64 char (should be start
       of new packet)

   | Type | start | stop | char/samp | data (base64) |

** Timestamp
   - Header is one byte (0x01)
   - next 8 bytes should define unix timestamp

   | Type | year | month | day | hour | minute | second |
